					<h3>Thank you for viewing this prototype</h3>
					<p>As you might remember, mixing of validated and unavlidated data never sat really well with me. However I am more and more convinced that we should embrace it. The client's explicit wish to do so (and the fact that no other client saw this differently), is a sign that I overestimated the importance of seperating the two data types. Combining both data types in one report has the following advantages:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Navigation is easier to understand: no switching between report types</li>
						<li>Fewer empty states: a report contains both validated and unvalidate data</li>
						<li>The date picker is easier to use: more dates have data</li>
						<li>Comparison between validated and unvalidated is much easier: the transition between the two is instant</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>But what if I only want to see validated data?</h3>
					<p>In this example I tried to keep it as simple as possible. Assuming that all data will be be validated once, viewing a report with only validated data requires the user to pick a date far enough back in time (2016 in this example). But offering only validated data (i.e. hiding unvalidated data), would be easy: a simple checkbox 'only show validated data' would suffice.</p>
