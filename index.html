					<h3>Thank you for viewing this prototype</h3>
					<p>As you might remember, the mixing of validated and unavlidated data never sat well with me. However I am more and more convinced that we should embrace it. The client's explicit wish to do so (and the fact that no other client saw this differently), is a sign that I might have I overestimated the importance of seperating the two data types. Combining both data types in one report has the following advantages:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Navigation is easier to understand:</b><br>
							No need to think about validated / unvalidated while choosing a date
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>The date picker is easier to use:</b><br>
							More dates are available because more dates have data (either validated or unvalidated).
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Information is easier to find:</b><br>
							Because a report contains both validated and unvalidate data there are fewer empty states
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Comparison between validated and unvalidated is easier:</b><br>
							Switching between the two is instant, requiring as little from the short term memory as possible.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>But what if I only want to see validated data?</h3>
					<p>I tried to keep this example as simple as possible. Assuming that all data will be be validated once, viewing a report with only validated data requires the user to pick a date far enough back in time (2016 in this example). But offering only validated data (i.e. hiding unvalidated data), would be easy. A simple checkbox <b>'only show validated data'</b> would suffice. Providing both options would make it a little more complex, but still very doable.</p>
